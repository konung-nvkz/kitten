# Kitten

## What is it?

App represents possible base for kitten adoption.
As it is under construction, some features may not work, or work in a wrong way.

According to my idea app will allow to see the base of kitten with the following information for each one:

- Name;
- Age;
- Gender;
- Photo;
- Check whether a kitten is adopted or not;
- Phone of coordinator.

According to my plans, uuid will help to generate unique ID.
MUI will be used to adopt styles for app.

God bless React.

## Notice

This is now an [OPEN Open Source](http://openopensource.org/) project. I am not able to invest a significant amount of time into maintaining Kitten and so am looking for volunteers who would like to be active maintainers of the project. If you are interested, shoot me a note.

## Technical information

This project was bootstrapped with the usage of:

- [React App v.18.2.0](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app);
- [Typescript v.4.9.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript/v/4.9.5);
- [Phone v. 3.1.40](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phone);

To learn about further dependencies, please look at package.json file.

## Available Scripts (adopted from React manual with minor editions)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.
Please note, I have changed it from the default port 3000,
in order it doesn't conflict to any other Apps in the system.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
