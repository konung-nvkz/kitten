# kitten

App represents possible base for kitten adoption.
As it is under construction, some features may not work, or work in a wrong way.

According to my idea app will allow to see the base of kitten with the following information:

- Their name;
- Their age;
- Gender;
- Photo;
- Check whether a kitten is Adopted or not;
- Phone of coordinator.

According to my plans, uuid will help to generate unique ID.
MUI will be used to adopt styles for app.

God bless React.
